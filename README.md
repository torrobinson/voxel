# voxel
Test writing a voxel-space renderer from scratch.
 
Inspired by what I saw in https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace, so I decided to attempt to write it without looking at the code, as the "terrain" (pun intended) was entirely new to me.

Must be run on a server as it uses javascript to fetch local resources.
